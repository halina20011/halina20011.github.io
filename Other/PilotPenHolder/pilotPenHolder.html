                    <p>I am too lazy to level the bed so that's why I've spent the last year or so reworking and improving this design.</p>
                    <p>In feature i will add images and examples of what you can do with it.</p>
                    <div class="fS8"></div>

                    <p>You will need a sping, I took it from gun toy</p>
                    <p>Spring has about 34mm in height and 14mm in diameter. Pilot Pen was choosen, because it has different colors and widths.</p>

                <h2>The story behind it</h2>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>The reason why I started working on this is because I had to hand in hand written essay/paper. So why to spend 10 minutes rewriting it on papaper when I spend unhealthy amout of time to make it "easyer"? Unfortunately I had problems with first two versions, because there were unprintable on my printer. So I write the essay/paper by hand and hand it... Later, third time I designed the part from scratch I made it more durable, modulable and printable.</p>
                    <p>When it came the time to print it I hade same issuies as last time. The resolution was terible. I first tryied to reach to someone who would print it on better printer as service, I was ignored by different people whom I asked (to be fare after some time I got one reptly, but that was late).</p>
                    <p>The other option left was to buy 0.2mm nozzle and try my luck with my printer. At first I didn't believe that it could succeed, but later, when I tried to print something with the new nozzle, the results were amazing. Yes the print time is kind of long, but the result is worth it.</p>
                    <p>So after discovering that my printer is capable of printing new iterations of my designs I got to work again.</p>
                    <p>Long story short after many prints and redisings this is what I have.</p>
